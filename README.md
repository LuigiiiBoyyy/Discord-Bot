# Discord-Bot
A discord bot, written in python, with several utility/meme generators/RPG elements and a feature-rich hangman game.

Run requirements:
1. Use python3 Main.py (or just python Main.py, but make sure python version is 3.6+ and not 2.7)
2. Needs sqlite3, pillow, requests, and discord packages installed (use python3 -m pip install X)
3. Tokens for the discord bot login (config.txt) and IMGFLIP account password (config2.txt) must be in folder named 'tokens' in main directory. These should be 1 line text files.

Note: Paths are currently setup to run in a windows environment. Adjustment will need to be made for running on Unix.
